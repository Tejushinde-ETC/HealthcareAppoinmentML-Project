# HealthcareAppoinmentML-Project
This is ML Project on Healthcare Appoinment NO_Shows predictions dataset. which contain 107k Rows and 15 column. In this dataset we perform various operations like converting data type , rename cloumns,  outliers, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables etc . The project also involves implementing six machine learning models to identify the best-performing model, with a focus on comparing performance both before and after addressing class imbalance. Finally, the most suitable model will be selected based on key performance metrics, and hyperparameter tuning will be conducted to optimize its performance.
